  We started off by creating a prototype in <strong>Figma</strong>. The mobile application was built using
  <strong>Flutter</strong> and Dart. We made use of <strong>Firebase</strong> for authentication and for saving user
  data. We used the Flutter Camera module to capture and display profile image in the app. We also used Flutter module
  and the <strong>Calender SDK</strong> to add a calendar and for adding events to it in the application. All in all,
  CollegeScape relies heavily on <strong>Google Could</strong> and the suite of SDKs and functionalities it provides to
  deliver our users a feature-rich experience.
</p>
<h2 id="challenges-we-ran-into-">Challenges we ran into🔴</h2>
<p>We ran into some problems with authentication as connecting applications with firebase can be troublesome sometimes.
  Flutter still being a little new to me, we faced some issues with the compatibility of the app with different devices
  and had to spend a lot of time fixing that.
  The app uses multiple functionalities, and integrating those for the perfect UX was a challenge in itself.</p>
<h2 id="accomplishments-that-we-re-proud-of-">Accomplishments that we&#39;re proud of🎖</h2>
<p>We were able to create our proper authentication system which we had never really tried before. We also explored
  Firestore in a deep way and got to understand how a few things worked a particular way. Getting the camera and
  firebase storage to work was tough but we were successful in making it work.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-learned-">What we learned📚</h2>
<p>We got more experience in flutter and firebase by building this application. Got to learn about different
  authentication systems and how everything interacts in the flutter application during authentication. We also got to
  learn about various flutter modules that came in handy while building CollegeScape.</p>
