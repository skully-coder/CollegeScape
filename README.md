We started off by creating a prototype in **Figma**. The mobile application was built using **Flutter** and Dart. We made use of **Firebase** for authentication and for saving user data. We used the Flutter Camera module to capture and display profile image in the app. We also used Flutter module and the **Calender SDK** to add a calendar and for adding events to it in the application. All in all, CollegeScape relies heavily on **Google Could** and the suite of SDKs and functionalities it provides to deliver our users a feature-rich experience.

## Challenges we ran intoðŸ”´
We ran into some problems with authentication as connecting applications with firebase can be troublesome sometimes. Flutter still being a little new to me, we faced some issues with the compatibility of the app with different devices and had to spend a lot of time fixing that.
The app uses multiple functionalities, and integrating those for the perfect UX was a challenge in itself.

## Accomplishments that we're proud ofðŸŽ–
We were able to create our proper authentication system which we had never really tried before. We also explored Firestore in a deep way and got to understand how a few things worked a particular way. Getting the camera and firebase storage to work was tough but we were successful in making it work.

## What we learnedðŸ“š
We got more experience in flutter and firebase by building this application.  Got to learn about different authentication systems and how everything interacts in the flutter application during authentication. We also got to learn about various flutter modules that came in handy while building CollegeScape.
